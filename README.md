# Bird Flock Analyser 

This Bird Flock Analyser is a System that processes Images through a suffisticated Algorithm.

The objective of this Project exercise was to create a JavaFX application that can be supplied with an
image/photo of a flock of birds in the sky. When given an image, the application should
automatically locate individual (and/or clusters of) birds and estimate how many of them are in the
image overall.
